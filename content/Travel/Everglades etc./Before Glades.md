The first thing you notice upon landing in Florida is the weather. The Miami airport is very well designed BUT it lacks good markings. I could spot several other passengers getting confused over the airport direction signs and falling back onto their smartphones.

I did not have time to explore Miami tonight. I rented a car and drove over to my airbnb. The rental facility is conveniently connected to the airport by a train (San Diego should learn). My airbnb is in a suburb of Miami, which is a little unfortunate, but good luck finding an affordable place in the city.

Fortunately for me there is a Cuban bakery, _Pinecrest Bakery_, close to my airbnb which is open 24 hrs :) I know where I'm getting my dinners from now. Turns out their *Chicken Empanadas* is quite good and they have nice _cafe con leche_. The server does not speak any English and I end up with a wad of 14 single dollar notes. A day well spent.

I have to wake up at 6 am tomorrow for my canoeing trip, but there is no way I'm getting a good night's sleep with all the new year's celebrations going on all over the city, oh well. I cannot see the fireworks I can at least hear them, that must count for something.
