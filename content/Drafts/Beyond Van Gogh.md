I saw this interesting "show" (not sure what to call it, experience?) yesterday about Van Gogh. What it was was a wide open room surrounded by tall walls on which Van Gogh's paintings were being projected while beautiful music played in the background. That's an understatement. The artist(s) had very literally taken apart his paintings and turned them into dynamic objects.

1. Starry night
2. Night Cafe
3. Street painting
4. Lilies

After this I went to a beyond Van Gogh experience. This was beautiful. I think it was a bit too expensive for the price but I could see the amount of effort the artist had put in it. They had _deconstructed_, very literally, all the various pieces in the painting and reassembled them in a unique way that made the paintings appear in motion. I remember especially two of them:
1. the starry night. first the whirls appear and then the rest of the painting. as if it was a sight being revealed after a storm. van gogh managed to extract some impressionistic essence of the real world and these artists then further extracted motion from his paintings.
2. the night cafe. here the magic afterward. once you've seen the painting for a while the camera pans up and you see the stars for themselves and you see the city from a perspective. this must have needed some real innovation - to turn a 2-d painting into 3-d.
3. i was moved moved by his paintings of lilies. i had seen it before but never admired it much. but this time i looked at it i wonder why he chose to paint it that way. why did he pick those strokes? why did he put two particular colors adjacent to each other? why did he decide to not mix them. 
4. There was one painting about his neighborhood which started with a sketch and the colors then filled themselves in. I was very impressed by his attention to details to all the people. I would honestly have been impressed by just the sketch. There was an old couple on the street, her hand wrapped around his arm. For some reason it really made me feel comfortable.
5. I was also moved by his quote - being an artist is understanding people. 

After the experience, I find it fascinating to imagine the kind of world he saw. 

I have to say that I was bit irritated by the people who were taking videos there and watching the thing through their cameras - why would you do that? why not just look at it through your own eyes, it's in HD! I found it funny that the people who were doing it were an old woman and a young kid.
