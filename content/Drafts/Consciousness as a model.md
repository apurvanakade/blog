- Add link to Lex Fridman podcast here.

After listerining to the Lex Fridman podcast I had some thoughts on what consciousness might be. 

The central question is what is consciousness and why do we have it? Why *are the lights on*? Why don't we just get data from the surroundings and thoughts and process it directly without any experience of knowing? This, for example, is what organims without nervous systems do. They directly react to stimuli. 

The non-trivial thing the brain does is that it creates models of the world. The models are used to make predictions about the future and determine the next course of action. These models get trained over our lifetimes to more accurately attain the desirable outcomes, which are in-built in our primitive systems which at the core are driven by evolutionary imperatives of the propagation of genetic information.

The raw sensory input is perceived and interpreted as light, sound, smell, taste, pressure, etc. and it helps us form a 3D-model of the world around us. In this model, there is a hole right at the center of where all the organs are and this hole is filled by another model - the model of *self*. Thus *the self* is a 3D-representation of the body. 

Now two things are happening in our brain - we are receiving sensory inputs which are being perceived and experience, and we have a model of the self which is moving through the 3D world. Both of these are occuring constantly and without a break. So another meta-model is created where *the self* is perceived as perceiving the sensory input. This provides a more coherent model for the world and possibly one that requires less processing as everything now fits in one 3D world. 

This also explains why *thoughts are localized*. Thoughts are just outputs from one part of the brain being inputed into another part of the brain. So the *process of thought creation* is happening within the brain but *thoughts* themselves don't exist in the 3D world and hence do not have x,y,z-coordinates. However, the 3D model for the world that we create is so robust and useful that we artificially *project the thoughts in our heads*. Similarly, the process of perception is happening in the brain but consciounsess itself in non-localized. It does not have position, or time coorditanes for that matter.

How to test this hypothesis?

Buddhists philosophy claims that by meditating on the sense of self we can disrupt our sense of self. I don't know how thoroughly this can be done but my guess is that even minor disruptions will lead to reconfiguring of the meta-model that is consciousness i.e. disruption of *self* should lead to change in consciousness. 

Another aspect of meditation is that it is done in stillness. I suspect that movement is precursor to our 3D-world creation. Removing movement from the equation perhaps allows for loosening of the 3D world model and perhaps dissolution of consciousness. 

I personally am not entirely sold on the scientificness of these "experiments" or the metaphysical truth behind them. I will need to think more about what would be a good way to objectively test this hypothesis.

I also don't believe that understanding consciousness is a necessary pursuit. But for me, personally, this is a very important question as
