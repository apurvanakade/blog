The fundamental insight of Buddhism, and I'm paraphrasing here, is that *suffering* is a result of an incorrect model of the world. 

Our brain builds models of the world and whenever there's a discrepancy it updates the model. These models are almost never accurate, by definition, a model is just an approximation of reality. Whenever there's a discrepancy, we try to correct the model. This discrepancy *is* conflict and suffering. 

The Buddhist claim is that the default models of self is broken. Why this happens is unclear to me. The fact that this is default suggests that this might be genetic hardwiring. There is evolutionary pressure to have an *incorrect model of self* - such individuals might be better at propagating their genes - possibly because they suffer a lot and genetic propagation is hard-wired to feel like it alleviates suffering. Searching for the correct model of self might be an imperative that gets hacked to produce more offsprings. 

The other Buddhist claim is that the model of *expected returns* is broken. We ascribe far greater value to a pleasant feeling even though through experience we know that the value is much lower. Again, this might be an evolutionary hack to motivate us to keep pursuing goals.
