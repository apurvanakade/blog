An idea from psychology I really like is the four stages of competence. Here's an [excerpt directly from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence):

> 1. **Unconscious incompetence.**
>    The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn.
>
> 2. **Conscious incompetence**.
>    Though the individual does not understand or know how to do something, they recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage.
> 3. **Conscious competence**.
>    The individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill.
> 4. **Unconscious competence.**
>    The individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become "second nature" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.

I would not have given this a second thought had I not taught math to undergrads (it's not a pretty sight). To me, then, the question is: what are the things _I_ am unconsciously incompetent at.

## Conscious Irrational Thinking

One thing no one can afford, especially today, is to be _unconsciously incompetent_ about rational thinking and decision making. There are already far too many incompetent idiots in the world and the situation is only getting worse by the day. What's worse is that neither our education systems nor the society at large have as yet evolved to deal with this crisis.

Meditation, for me, is one way to become more aware of my irrational thoughts. I do not think I can become more rational by meditating. That's what thinking is for. But rational thinking is often [incapable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) of figuring out its own shortcomings. I do not think irrational thinking is bad, there would be no art without it. But I do think it is important _to know_ what mode of thinking you are using when making decisions. Meditation is just a facilitator to become more aware and cognizant of your thinking process.

## Open Loops

When I medidate at night, once the mind starts to settle down after the initial phase of chaos, I start getting a list of things that need to be taken care of. [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) calls these the "open loops". As you live your everyday life, your brain accumulates a bunch of unfinished thoughts, threads that have not been closed in a loop. You might be running or wasting some time on youtube and you would suddenly remember that there was this paper you were supposed to read. That's a sign that your brain has been keeping track of things subconsciously and needs your attention.

Meditation gives you an opportunity to become aware of these open loops, which then you can deal with in real life.

## Self-Therapy

I have started thinking of my brain as a symbiotic organism living inside my skull, which is technically true if you think about how little of the brain processing is conscious thought. You are the only _person_ your brain can communicate with. It is almost a moral obligation of yours to listen to what it has to say. Fundamentally, meditation is just listening.
