I love words.

I found this [wholesome link](https://jolabokaflod.org/about/founding-story/) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7jtfju/til_an_icelandic_tradition_called_j%C3%B3lab%C3%B3kafl%C3%B3%C3%B0/) while I was doing some work (\*cough\*). As the US is riling under Mr. Pai's proud accomplishments there are some countries that have figured it all out.

> Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalogue – called Bókatíðindi (‘Book Bulletin’, in English) – that is sent to every household in the country in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair. People use the catalogue to order books to give friends and family for Christmas.

> During the festive season, gifts are opened on 24 December and, by tradition, everyone reads the books they have been given straight away, often while drinking hot chocolate or alcohol-free Christmas ale called jólabland.

I wonder how different US would be if it adopted this tradition, what would an India be in which everybody read Harry Potter. May be this Christmas gift a book, a childish book about magic and goblins, and dreams and wonder. The balder I get the easier it becomes for me to get too serious about life and overlook the all pervading absurdity. Perhaps the world would be a happier place if we embrace the chaos and unreason and work with it instead of trying to tame it, as Camus put it wisely *one must imagine Sisyphus happy*.
