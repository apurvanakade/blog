I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?

In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside. When I wasn't saving the world from the tyrannies of homeworks I was unsuccessfully installing Linux distros on it. And yet, as of today, I haven't found Linux to be particularly useful.

For me the charm of programming lies in it's mysteriousness, it's complexity and it's abstraction, in the myriad hidden layers, each successively simplifying the next one making it more useable, until I can create this blog by editing a few hundred lines of code!
