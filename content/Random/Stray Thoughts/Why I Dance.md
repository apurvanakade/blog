I've recently been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. Turns out this is a really hard question. The biggest difficulty is probably trying to understand what it means to *do something* with your life. 

Right now I'm coming back from a dance meet-up with some old friends and new, a little tipsy and drinking some more, and a *lot* exhilarated from moving on the dance floor. 

There are two extreme contexts in which one can view oneself. There is the really wide perspective; where you're here for a finite amount of time, almost by an accident against all probabilities. And then there is the narrow one; where you have been presented with all these moments to live, every moment unique. 

But it is hard to see either of these extreme views. Somehow we aren't accustomed to experiencing them day in and day out. 

And then there are several other contexts which we live by instead, our families, our friends, our work, our society. 

When I dance it frees me of these intermediate contexts, I'm living the moment when I'm dancing, and when I stop dancing I get detached from time and space, as if having an outer body experience. I sometimes get the same feeling when I'm concentrating on a yoga pose, or when I've been hiking in the wild for a while, or when I've been working on a really juicy maths problem. 

I love living these moments, for these are moments of great clarity.

And I think that in these moments I see an answer. 

I want to create. It doesn't matter what I create, so long as it's beautiful. I think this is what I want to do with my life, I want to constantly create something beautiful.

This is why I love to dance, as every dance, however ephemeral, is a beautiful creation, a beautiful moment floating in time,

Created by me.
