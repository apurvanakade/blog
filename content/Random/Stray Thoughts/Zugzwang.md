__Zugzwang__

> _(n.)_ a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one's turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage, often in the final years of grad school.

I don't understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it's fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.

This video is about a game between Deepmind and the world's strongest chess engine. It's amusing (scary?) to hear the dude refer to Deepmind as _he_ occasionally, AIs are people too. It is not too surprising that AIs are really good at chess but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.

Given that AIs have taken over the data world and are soon going to enter our cars and homes I believe the biggest question on everybody's mind is, when are they going to learn to grade homeworks and exams?
