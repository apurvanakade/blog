There is an official page on [Active.com](http://activesupport.force.com/usersupport/articles/en_US/Article/64-95-Charge) about what an unidentified charge of $79.95 on your bank statement means. How many such websites have you seen in your life? Here is a website that deceptively charges you hoping that you're stupid enough to not check your credit card statement. Apparently, Active.com is one of the most successful marathon event registration website and it is popular even though this scam is extremely well known. I hope it gets sued and goes bankrupt soon.
