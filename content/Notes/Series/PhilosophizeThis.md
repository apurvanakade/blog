I have never been much of a philosopher. I find the subject tedious,
arguing round and round in circles about things without ever getting
anywhere. It is obvious to me why science and mathematics split off of
philosophy. To my great surprise then, I recently binged the podcast
[Philosophize This!](http://philosophizethis.org/) and found it quite
fascinating. But to me, this was a podcast about the history of human
thought, and I love history.

I won\'t say that I have started liking philosophy but this podcast has
given me a lot of raw material to think about. I really like Stephen
West\'s simplified style of delivery and presentation. (Although, he
sometimes digresses and starts talking about his own life problems and
opinions which I don\'t particularly
enjoy.)

The podcast is presented in a more or less chronological order. It is
fascinating to see how our understanding of the world and our ideas have
changed so rapidly in the past few centuries. The inventor of modern
reason, Descartes, the smartest man in his days, gives a loopy proof of
the existence of god until inevitably Nietzsche proclaims his death and
portends the end of
religion.

Most importantly, to me, listening to this podcast explained the
origins of my own
thoughts.
