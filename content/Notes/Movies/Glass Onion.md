Sequel to Knives Out.

It must be very difficult to make a good detective movie today, since there has already been so many such movies and the entire point of a detective movie is in the suspense. If the audience gets even so much as a clue of how the mystery is resolved the entire movie gets spoiled. But glass onion manages to surmount this steep challenge with ease.

The trope used to accomplish this is the same as one used in the prequel - a Rashomon style fracturing of the story-telling that manages to hide the truth in plain sight. It is almost like a magic trick. There is misdirection through editing that makes you think that the queen is under the middle cup when the queen was under the magician's sleeve the entire time. 

To top it all off the comedy is subtle and timely, just what a movie like this needs.
