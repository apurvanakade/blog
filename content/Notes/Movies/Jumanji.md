Goo watch Jumanji. I've now become a fan of Kevin Hart after watching this movie. There is no sarcasm, no deadpan humor, nothing vulgar, nothing *GTA-Hangover* style, nobody ever makes fun of anybody else, all the humor is benignly self-deprecating. It's a heartwarming, wholesome, adventurous, gripping, innocent movie. I'm pretty sure nobody says fuck or shit in the movie even once. And it's still funny. I know! Who would have thought? There are a few corny moments but never too many. I had forgotten about the existence of good funny innocent movies. 

Gooo watch Jumanji in the theaters so that they make more movies like this.

Also what makes Kevin Hart so funny? I dunno. He has great comic timing, extremely funny and exaggerated expressions and that air of a proud but helpless guy suffering from constant misfortune around him.
