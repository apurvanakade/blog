I gave an hour long talk at the [NU Math Club](https://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/prizes-competitions-organizations/northwestern-undergraduate-math-society.html) yesterday about Lean and theorem proving. 


## Things that went well

It was fun to talk about Lean and to show examples.
The most fun bit was playing with the [Lean Chat plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoskinson-ml.lean-chat-vscode) for VS Code, which has gotten quite good now.


## Things that did not go well

It was a bit tedious to talk about Type Theory. 
I need to find better ways to motivate and explain Type Theory, especially the significance of constructors.
I could do examples from Haskell or Lean to just show the thing in action.

I could have just skipped the type theory bit completely and just spent the entire time talking about Lean and perhaps doing an example from scratch. 


## To Do

As I was preparing for the talk, I came across [this blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-math-theorem-proving/) and the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11491)  by FacebookAI which claims to have made improvements in AI assisted theorem proving. I need to read more about it.

I also need to find some expository texts on Type Theory, especially about the Type Theory used in Lean.
