I have heard [Matthew Walker](https://youtu.be/5MuIMqhT8DM) talk about sleep, [a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig).
But I never really took him seriously. 
I find him preachy and his talks are always exaggerated.
The first time I got really curious about sleep is when I heard this talk:

One of the silver linings of this depressing lockdown is that this has given me a lot of time to reflect and introspect, look inwards as they say.
I have developed supernatural observational and organizational skills. 
I keep a record of almost everything these days, which is easy to do, as I'm never too far from a computer.

Thanks to growing up in india, I find it very difficult to sleep in complete silence, which is non-existent there. 
I fall asleep easily with a youtube video (usually an episode of [QI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kl2_c0rsyU&list=PL2QUAXGgB_cLSCyImuY3aWS-4gCRTxFA-)) playing in the background. 
But apparently, even briefly looking at a bright screen (even in night-mode) degrades your sleep quality. 
I have been trying to switch to podcasts but I haven't yet found one that I can hear while sleeping.

I have found several for my afternoon walks though. 
During one of the said walks, I came across this podcast where the guest is a sleep specialist. 
She presents a very simple experiment: do not use any alarms for a few days and make a record of your sleep schedule.
I have since started documenting my going-to-bed and waking-up times.
I had been using Fitbit for this but my Fitbit broke and in retrospect its data was highly inaccurate and I never analyzed it seriously.

The good news is that I don't think that I'm a night owl.
The sad news is that I'm probably extremely sleep deprived. 
I think I need at least 9 hours of sleep every night but I can't remember the last time I got that much sleep on a regular basis.

Data is beautiful. Now getting enough sleep is one my top goals.
