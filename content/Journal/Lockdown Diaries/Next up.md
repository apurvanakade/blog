I haven't been able to write enough the past year. 
<br >
That's because I haven't been able to read enough the past year. 



Poem.



The *joys* of teaching at a public university have been a tad too appetizing for me. But on the bright side, they have prepared me well for this new social distancing lifestyle. Long before you all started trying it out, I was already a world renowned expert in the art.



I am starved of writing. I have some kind of a primal desire to write and the less I write the more I have to write about and so the less I write the more I write the next time I get a chance to write.



It is not entirely true that I haven't been writing. But much of my writing is rumination. I have been a lot of time thinking about things that I 



My attitude toward life has drastically changed since coming to Canada and starting my postdoc here. Having a capital j job has been one of the main reasons ofc but there are also several other factors, one of which is my reading of books on habits and the human mind and psychology. In some over over an indeterminate period of time I happened to read the following books.

1. Thinking fast, thinking slow
2. Phantoms in the Brain
3. Checklist manifesto
4. Getting Things Done
5. 12 rules of life

And slowly but surely my entire outlook of the world has changed. I am still a total dick at my core, so you can stop worrying about that. But my attitude toward myself has changed drastically. 





the past academic year, which is almost but not quite over, has been one of great turbulence and changes. most unwelcome. i would package them as a learning experience, but the honest truth is that i would die happily even if i never had them. i would no be missing out on much.

i got to see the working of a public university in person, up close, and a canadian university at that. i have come out with a greater appreciation of capitalism. but that is not what i want to write about. i want to write about something simple and mundane but something that has been very important to me.

when you work at a severely under-staffed place

there comes a point in every academic's life when they have to learn to get their shit together. perhaps, this happens "organically" for some people but for me this was a result of finding myself in an severely under-staffed place where ...

then i had also been reading a lot about the brain and psychology and human behavior and had become severely entrenched in the idea that humans beings do not have much free will. we are slaves to our habits and if i need to work on myself i need to get my habits in order.

i have been experimenting a lot with what works and what does not. i have a very rebellious nature and i do not like discipline. i do not follow rules easily and am all for anarchy. but, i have also come to the realization that there are certain systems that need more structure to function, that discipline can be used as a tool in the right hands. And so I have come around to liking it and appreciating it. i also grown to love balance rather than the extremes. i still love chaos but i understand that utter chaos leads to nothing and is unstable.

After much experimentation i have come to exactly 2 rules i follow every day in my life.

Rule 1. I get out of my bed at 7 everyday, no matter what. There are days when i just wake up only to fall asleep on the commode for an hour. That's ok. The important thing is to not be horizontal come 7 o'clock.

Rule 2. I keep a daily to-do list and everyday before sleeping i finish everything on the to-do list.

The second rule is not easy to follow. The few times I tried using a to-do list (after getting inspired by the checklist manifesto and GTD) I never could keep up. That's because I did not have my expectations properly calibrated. I used to try and estimate the amount of times (the number of Pomodoro ffs) needed to finish a task but that's hubris and leads to planning fallacy. Now my to-do list contains only the most essential things I absolutely have to do that day and is open to interpretation. I have a to-do item about daily writing. And while the intended purpose is to write in a daily journal somedays that's not possible because maybe I need to spend an extra hour on teaching. In which case, writing calculus counts as daily writing. i keep an auxiliary todo list containing the optional things that I need to get done someday. I also keep meticulous records on tiddlywiki so that my brain gets out of the habit of storing everything.

This might seem trivial but given the current situation i could not have been...

this habit comes as a superpower in these confining times. i actually feel like i have been given a great opportunity to reset myself. i have discovered more parks in my city in the last couple of weeks than in the entire year before that.

Here is a list of books I recommend to get started

I can see a theme forming. I am going to write a lot of small blog posts about my various thoughts about life.
