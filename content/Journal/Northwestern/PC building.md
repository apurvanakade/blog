I built my first PC! There were several Black Friday discounts that make the build substantially cheaper. Still the price ended up being slightly higher than I had hoped.

## Case

I had a problem with the first case I bought. There are apparently 3 sizes of motherboards - ATX, Micro ATX, and Mini ATX. 
My motherboard is ATX, which is largest size for a motherboard, but the original case only supported Micro and Mini, so I had to exchange for a different one. 
The new case is quite spacious and everything fits perfectly.


## Steps

1. **Assemble the motherboard** - put the CPU, CPU fan, RAM, NVMe hard disk on the motherboard. 
My CPU fan came with some pre-applied thermal paste so I did not need to add any extra.
Only the NVMe installation was tricky.
The motherboard comes with tiny screws for fixing the hard disk.
1. **Attach the motherboard to the case**
2. **Connect the Case cables to the motherboard** - the connections for the power and reset button are very tricky and poorly marked. You need to carefully read the motherboard manual for this.
3. **Attach the graphics card** 
4. **Connect the power supply cables** - i needed three cables: two for the motherboard and one for the graphics card 
5. **Connect the power supply to the case**

Done!
