Laban categorized human movement into four component parts:

* <b>Space</b>
* <b>Time</b>
* <b>Weight</b>
* <b>Flow</b>

Each of those parts has two elements:

* Space is either <b>direct</b> or <b>indirect</b>.
* Speed is either <b>quick</b> or <b>sustained</b>.
* Weight is either <b>heavy</b> or <b>light</b>.
* Flow is either <b>bound</b> or <b>free</b>.

In class, we mainly focused on the <b>eight efforts</b>.
