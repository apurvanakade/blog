  <div class="post"><p>For the lack of better things to do, I have been visiting my dentist lately.
The x-ray machine they had looked like it came straight out of the Starship Enterprise.
While I was getting my teeth drilled, even though I was sweating profusely and barely managed to not shit in my pants, I could not but marvel at the fact that I had my tooth drilled and filled in less than an hour!
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll find better, more elegant ways of doing this in the future, maybe we&rsquo;ll be using nanobots and lasers.
But even now what we have felt nothing short of magic.
It takes longer to fix my car than to fix my teeth.</p>
<p>When I was in Chennai, there was no hospital near our college.
We had to take a bus to another town to go this huge medical college.
Whenever one of our friends had to visit, we would make a trip out of it because the food in the cafeteria there used to me amazing.
And I&rsquo;ve always loved the sight of medical students running around with writing pads with their prim white uniforms and soon to be extinguished smiles.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m not too sick, I love visiting the doctor/hospital. It is an experience, a bit like going to the movies or to a museum. I&rsquo;m fascinated by the machines, the technology, the chemicals, the science.
I love all the tests that they do, even when they take blood samples (not scared of needles).
It is almost like being a kid again and letting your parents take care of you and fix things for you.
To me it is a source of never ending wonder how doctors can figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with you just by poking you with a few instruments or putting your blood through some test-tubes and adding chemicals to them.
What a miracle!</p>
