  <div class="post"><p>I have heard <a href="https://youtu.be/5MuIMqhT8DM">Matthew Walker</a> talk about sleep, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig">a lot</a>.
But I never really took him seriously.
I find him preachy and his talks are always exaggerated.
The first time I got really curious about sleep is when I heard this talk:

One of the silver linings of this depressing lockdown is that this has given me a lot of time to reflect and introspect, look inwards as they say.
I have developed supernatural observational and organizational skills.
I keep a record of almost everything these days, which is easy to do, as I&rsquo;m never too far from a computer.</p>
<p>Thanks to growing up in india, I find it very difficult to sleep in complete silence, which is non-existent there.
I fall asleep easily with a youtube video (usually an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kl2_c0rsyU&amp;list=PL2QUAXGgB_cLSCyImuY3aWS-4gCRTxFA-">QI</a>) playing in the background.
But apparently, even briefly looking at a bright screen (even in night-mode) degrades your sleep quality.
I have been trying to switch to podcasts but I haven&rsquo;t yet found one that I can hear while sleeping.</p>
<p>I have found several for my afternoon walks though.
During one of the said walks, I came across this podcast where the guest is a sleep specialist.
She presents a very simple experiment: do not use any alarms for a few days and make a record of your sleep schedule.
I have since started documenting my going-to-bed and waking-up times.
I had been using Fitbit for this but my Fitbit broke and in retrospect its data was highly inaccurate and I never analyzed it seriously.</p>

<p>The good news is that I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m a night owl.
The sad news is that I&rsquo;m probably extremely sleep deprived.
I think I need at least 9 hours of sleep every night but I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I got that much sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Data is beautiful. Now getting enough sleep is one my top goals.</p>
