      <title>The French Dispatch</title>

      <description>Going in, I was quite skeptical of this movie. I had seen the trailer and it looked pretentious. There were a hundred different big named actors in a hundred-min-long movie. It seemed too fake to be good. It did not help that the theater I was in was bad with a small, awkwardly placed screen, seats that did not recline, and poor sound quality. At the start of the movie I could barely make out what the actors were saying or what was happening on the screen, each scene being so densely packed with detail.</description>

      <title>Ad Astra</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious. Brad Pitt has managed to give the performance of a lifetime in Ad Astra. There are many scenes in the movie when he just emotes, there is nothing else going on in the entire frame, just him in focus with melancholic colors of space and science providing the stage. You can see his expressions go through an array of subtle but powerful changes, a slight tremor in an eyebrow, a hesitant blink, a slight quivering of the lips, a surreptitious teardrop that betrays the stoic facade.</description>

      <title>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse</title>

      <description>There is something special about Spiderman. Though not the most powerful superhero, he is unmistakably charming, with a good sense of humor, which was probably why his movies were the ones to launch the modern superhero genre. And because he is not so grim and serious, somehow the same characteristics spill over into his world, and as a result we get a very entertaining set of villains, just like for Batman.</description>

      <title>The Handmaiden</title>

      <description>This movie is Rashomon meets Oldboy meets a Tinto Brass.
There is something disturbing about Korean thriller films. It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps exaggerated by my lack of knowledge of the Korean culture, it feels very alien, disconnected, happenning in a shadow world, fragmented, a snowstorm in a crystal ball.
In The Handmaiden this is further amplified by the setting. The movie starts with a scene in a poverty-riden Korean, immediately contrasted with a serene dreamlike scene following a lonely car through a famous-five island, on a curving road, through through woods and darkness and distictly Japanese gardens.</description>

      <description>What? Is? This? [Movie?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDlzWH1wgJA) Imagine watching the climax of a Charlie Chaplin or a Three Stooges movie as a kid; people are running helter-skelter all over the place, things get so chaotic that you have no idea as to what is going on, your eyes are constantly jumping from one character to another unable to keep up with the ongoing chaos; and yet you are on the edge of your seat with a foolishly wide grin stuck to your face which stubbornly refuses to shut, and it&amp;rsquo;s only when dust settles and you sink back into your seat bursting out uncontrollably laughing that you realize you had forgotten to breathe.</description>

      <description>I always wonder what exactly is the world that Wes Anderson sees, does he really see things the way he portrays them in his movies? What a great gift to have, I&amp;rsquo;m so envious!
Like all other Wes Anderson movies, Isle of Dogs makes no pretense of being serious or dark in any way. At the very start, there is a narrator who announces that this is a tale and introduces the story.</description>

      <title>Paddington 2</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Paddington, and frankly the only reason I decided to watch Paddington 2 is because of it&amp;rsquo;s insanely high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
The ratings are not exaggerated. This is a beautifully made movie, everything about this movie is good.
  I&amp;rsquo;ll only say this, watching this movie is not unlike reading a Harry Potter book (Hagrid is in the movie!). The story is tactfully written, as if by Rowling herself, but much more cheerful, without any hint of an underlying sadness.</description>

      <title>Shape of Water</title>

      <description>Guillermo del Toro&amp;rsquo;s best work is undoubtedly Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth, a bittersweet dreamlike tale of a young girl who finds herself in the unknown forests of Spain.
This new movie of his, Shape of Water, in some ways tries to recreate the same feel. The premise is completely different but the setting is exactly as in Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth. There is an unfortunate damsel with evil parents/bosses who comes in contact with magical creatures and finds an escape from &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>*“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.”* - 1984 Icarus is a shocking film about an American filmmaker getting accidentally intertwined with head of the Russian anti-doping lab, Rodchenkov, during the unfolding of the Russian doping scandal. It starts out with the juxtaposition of Lance Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s testimonies before and after his conviction of guilt, and that sets the tone for the rest of the film.</description>

      <title>Jumanji</title>

      <description>Goo watch Jumanji. I&amp;rsquo;ve now become a fan of Kevin Hart after watching this movie. There is no sarcasm, no deadpan humor, nothing vulgar, nothing GTA-Hangover style, nobody ever makes fun of anybody else, all the humor is benignly self-deprecating. It&amp;rsquo;s a heartwarming, wholesome, adventurous, gripping, innocent movie. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure nobody says fuck or shit in the movie even once. And it&amp;rsquo;s still funny. I know! Who would have thought?</description>
