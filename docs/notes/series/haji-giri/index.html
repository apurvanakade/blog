<p>I am fascinated by Japan, the country that has produced Naruto, Bleach, Akira, Ghost in the shell, Murakami, Ishiguro, Miyazaki and so much more.
An inward-looking, closed island riddled with lost youth and a dying population that has somehow managed to preserve its culture in the present and has had so much influence on the world. It is mystical, fantastic, spiritual, and simultaneously one of the biggest purveyors of porn.</p>
<p>I am also fascinated by Britain, by its rich history and its diverse culture.
The place where modern science and democracy originated, the country of harry potter, another very dreamy and mythical place.
There is just something about island nations. It is said that the art of a land reflects its geography. Perhaps that is the reason then why Japanese &amp; English art is disconnected from the rest of the world, self-centered.</p>
<p>Haji/Giri was a treat for me. The series seamlessly melds Japanese and English cultures while constantly contrasting them. Set in Tokyo and London, it is superficially a cop drama but really is about how difficult being a person is and how one can form connections with someone across the pond. Every character is damaged and complicated and there are no superheroes. I loved the storytelling and editing. You never know which character you’re supposed to root for. There is so much deception and subtext that it becomes hard to keep track of the meaning of what is said. The creators of this series have also added a nice artistic touch to the cinematography. There is a scene in the last episode right before an intense climax which is a slow and pensive modern dance! I simply loved that. The length of the series is perfect. With just 8 episodes this is closer to a long movie than a short series.</p>
