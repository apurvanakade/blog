      <title>The Gene: An Intimate History</title>
      <link>https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/notes/books/gene/</link>

      <guid>https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/notes/books/gene/</guid>
      <description>This book is the story of the birth, growth, and future of one of the most powerful and dangerous ideas in the history of science: the “gene,” the fundamental unit of heredity, and the basic unit of all biological information.
 When you read good books, you start immersing yourself into the world of its words. Everytime you open its pages a parallel universe emerges for you transgress. And when the book is really good, you leave a different person.</description>

      <title>Stories of Your Life and Others</title>

      <description>This is one of those rare sci-fi books that managed to bore me. So much so that I left the last short story halfway through, out of exasperation. I was really looking forward to the book because of Arrival. The story that inspired Arrival, Story of Your Life, is indeed quite good but the rest of the short stories I found to be too dry. (It is certainly possible that I&amp;rsquo;ve just outgrown short stories).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t understand it without an explanation, you can&amp;rsquo;t understand it with an explanation.&amp;quot;
- 1Q84
 What most surprised me about 1Q84 is that I actually liked reading it! I have read enough Murakami that as I was reading the book I knew that he was not going to explain anything and yet I did not feel frustrated. I have developed a taste for his writing.</description>

      <description>&#34;The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don&#39;t.&#34;  Rereading the five books in The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide trilogy is the best self-care I’ve done throughout the pandemic.
I would have loved to meet Douglas Adams, what a great guy he must have been to be friends with! It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to imagine the kind of personality and world view one would have to have to create such an imaginative and fascinating adventure story.</description>

      <description>With every Camus book there are two major problems:
 The writing is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French. The meaning is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French.  In spite of this, I just cannot get enough of his books. He is the most enlightened person I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.
The Fall is the story of a benevolent lawyer who is always going out of his ways to help others, a hugely successful lawyer who offers his services to the poor for free.</description>

      <guid>https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/notes/books/crime-and-punishment/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?&amp;quot;
 Crime and Punishment is Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s criticism of naive rationalism, utilitarianism, and armchair philosophizing. For such a boring topic, this is a surprisingly fun read. Adhering to his own criticism, Dostoevsky does not take to prophesying and making grand philosophical arguments about the pros and cons of communism but instead weaves an interesting and entertaining narrative of what might happen if one were to take rationalism to its extreme.</description>

      <description>“Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.”  The central question, says Camus, is that of suicide. If you are going to die one day, why not just kill yourself now?
Starting from here, he develops the philosophy of the absurd.</description>

      <description>&#34;...when we’re done with it, we may find—if it’s a good novel—that we’re a bit different from what we were before we read it, that we have been changed a little, as if by having met a new face, crossed a street we never crossed before. But it’s very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed.&#34;  I do not think I understand this book at all.</description>

      <title>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</title>
      <link>https://apurvanakade.github.io/blog/notes/books/running-murakami/</link>

      <description>&#34;Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life—and for me, for writing as well.</description>

      <description>HBO is bringing out a remixed version of the Watchmen and it brings back some very fond memories.
When I first saw Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Watchmen I had never heard of Alan Moore or Neil Gaiman. I had seen Snyder&amp;rsquo;s flashy, extreme slo-moed, over the top 300 which, if nothing else, was an enjoyable watch. I did enjoy watching Watchmen too, but unlike 300, Watchmen was a revolutionary movie for me as it introduced me to the genre of graphic novels.</description>

      <description>Sherlock Holmes was perhaps one of the first non-school books I have ever read. My first books were goosebumps, nancy drew, hardy boys and then I graduated to Sherlock Holmes and LOTR.
I mostly read Sherlock in the summer, when I would have a lot of free time and would often be traveling to see my extended family in the hot and sunny rural India, where there would be no electricity and no TV.</description>

      <description>&#34;Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is.&#34; -Three Body Problem  Of the Three Body Problem trilogy, I immensely enjoyed reading the first book and had to drag my way across the other two.
The first book has a very beautiful structure. It is intensely gripping with very honest, well-formed characters, it jumps across various timelines introducing us to the Chinese cultural revolution along the way, has a whodunit mystery, creates great sci-fi worlds - a complete package.</description>

      <description>&#34;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&#34; -Neuromancer  I always knew that The Matrix had to have found it&amp;rsquo;s concepts from some book, it was too revolutionary a movie to have spawned out of nothing. And I finally found it - Neuromancer, the archetypal cyberpunk novel.
This is probably the hardest and simultaneously the most riveting sci-fi novel I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.</description>

      <description>&#34;The human race has to live with its conscience. Whatever the Hermians argue, survival is not everything.&#34; -Rendezvous with Rama  I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards space novels. Reading about space travel and stars and planets and contemplating the huge vastness and emptiness always fills me with a sense of indescribable wonder, bliss, and humility.
Arthur Clarke&amp;rsquo;s Rendezvous with Rama is a space poetry. It starts with a simple premise of an alien object (Rama) suddenly appearing in the solar system and humans venturing out to explore it.</description>

      <description>&#34;As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.</description>

      <description>In the opening scene of Nolan&amp;rsquo;s Prestige, Michael Caine explains what a magic trick consists of - a pledge, a turn, and the hardest part - the Prestige. This is what Asimov&amp;rsquo;s stories are like. He starts with an ordinary world with something slightly extraordinary about it, takes you around on a tour through the wonders of the world to distract you and slowly builds up the mystery in plain sight, until the big reveal in the final act.</description>

When we have gone in and looked around for a long while, just breathing and finally taking it in &amp;ndash; then we will be able to speak in our own voice and to stay in the present moment. And that moment is home.</description>

      <description>&#34;Man is fallible, but maybe men are less so.&#34; -The Checklist Manifesto  It is such a simple idea, and yet so hard to follow. When your work is complicated, involves serious teamwork, needs to be done in a time critical manner, is prone to errors of oversight; make a checklist. Follow it diligently, and upgrade it frequently. The purpose of a checklist is not to replace human thought, but to take care of the trivialities so that the mind can focus on more important things.</description>

      <description>“One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.” - Sophocles
 Oh man, what do I say about this novel? It was excruciating to keep reading it, perhaps for something like 90% of the novel my mental state was somewhere between mildly frustrated and benignly annoyed. But I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I persisted and finished the damn thing.
The story is narrated by a butler, a Mr.</description>

      <description>Survival is insufficient, is what it says on the lead caravan of the Traveling Symphony, a group of actors and musicians traversing the treacherous post-Georgian-Flu world which has wiped out most of humanity and destroyed the human civilization leaving behind scattered towns and technological relics.
Station Eleven jumps across three timelines - pre, post, and during the apocalypse - following the lives of three people who by a chance of fate are brought together momentarily and whose lives then diverge into the past and the future along a fragile web, their stories bursting out of a single moment in time.</description>

      <description>These are some notes I took from the book Getting Things Done by David Allen. Let me first start with the cons of the book. First the book is tediously repetitive, while some repetition is good to drill the concepts deep in your mind, the book overdoes it. Second, the book is clearly intended for people who&amp;rsquo;ve white collar jobs, mostly managers and executives.
But that does not mean that you cannot gatecrash the party.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What happens when people open their hearts?&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;They get better.” - Norwegian Wood
 Norwegian Wood is a teenage love story/coming of age story set mainly in Tokyo and the mountains of Kyoto. The name derives from the eponymous song by the Beatles.
I have very mixed feelings about the book. On one hand, the book has a very pulp feeling to it. There are too many sex scenes described with unnecessary details (the scenes aren&amp;rsquo;t even interesting, just teenagers jerking each other off) and every conversation between the protagonists eventually converges towards sex, love, and masturbation.</description>

      <description>An Area of Darkness is a disturbing pessimistic novel written by V.S. Naipaul about his first visit to India in 1962. This was India not too long after the Independence with it&amp;rsquo;s freshly minted Constitution, trying to make a transition from an English past to an Indian future. Naipaul shares the sentiments of West, the tone of the book is not unlike Slumdog Millionaire (a very unpopular movie in India).</description>

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read this book you should drop everything that you&amp;rsquo;re doing and start reading it right away. It is extremely well written and easy to read, with short chapters and lucid Hemingway-styled language lacking any pretentiousness.
Danny Kanny posits a two system model for our minds. The faster system which is also the system truly in charge, Mr.</description>
