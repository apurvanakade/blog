      <title>Television Addiction</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Television&amp;rdquo;, or in its current avatar &amp;ldquo;netflix&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;youtube&amp;rdquo; or whatever new fad exists these days, is really the modern day opium and alcohol. David Foster Wallace understood this. So did Don DeLillo. I have only recently started noticing this pernicious quality about telivision. This is what Aldous Huxley meant by Soma. We have created Soma without even realizing it. We partake in its consumption, both individually and as a society, and it makes us less individualistic.</description>

      <title>On History</title>

      <description>I have been reading Stephen Fry&amp;rsquo;s Making History and it got me thinking about history and my hate-love relationship with it.
Growing up, there was a hierarchy of subjects at school. Maths, &amp;ldquo;science 1&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;science 2&amp;rdquo; were at the very top and history at the very bottom, bottomer even than the languages. And deservedly so, for history in my school consisted entirely of memorizing which king farted where and what were the ten benefits of having the page numbers of the Indian constitution start from zero instead of one.</description>

      <description>I used to love watching Ted Talks, but of late I think the institution has very much lost its way and its originality and has become overly preachy and full of generic platitudes. It is great then to come across a Ted talk that I feel happy to share.
  It has helped me a lot during my grad school to be able to adapt my research as needed. It took me a while, but I eventually figured out that I am not very keen on proving grand conjectures but prefer working on small projects.</description>

      <title>Reminiscing Windows</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t used any Microsoft product since I came to the US. I fleetingly toyed with the idea of using Windows 10 but having seen the glory days of Windows 98 I just could not tolerate this monstrosity.
I stumbled upon this article about the silent resurgence of Microsoft as the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable company and the article for some reason made me a tad bit happy.
Growing up in India, Apple was not a concept I was even vaguely aware of.</description>

      <title>Ron Swanson</title>

      <description>&#34;I know what I&#39;m about son.&#34;  Ron Swanson is the simply the best Swanson.
I watch all kinds of comedy and I love all kinds of comedy. Good comedians are great philosophers who bring out the absurdities in life. They&amp;rsquo;re great observers, great listeners, great communicators, great actors, and great thinkers.
Good comedians extract humor out of the simplest of things. Ron Swanson finds it in silence. While many comedians are loud, energetic, emphatic, expressive and do great caricature, Ron manages to be funny by not doing anything, a master of deadpan comedy, he&amp;rsquo;s the punctuation marks in the otherwise unpunctuated soliloquies of Leslie Knopes.</description>

      <title>Joy of Running</title>

      <description>The running high is like having a prolonged orgasm.
I have a love-hate relationship with running. At the core of it, it is an extremely repetitive act, you&amp;rsquo;re doing one thing and one thing only, but then it is this simplicity of action that puts you in a trance. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the time before you start running and the time at the beginning of the run are excruciating, there is just no rational reason to subject yourself to such a monotonous ordeal.</description>

      <title>Blank Spaces</title>

      <description>When I was making this blog I fidgeted around a lot with the style, trying to make it look pretty but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it right. Until I realized that what makes a lot of websites pretty are the blank spaces.
This is, in fact, true for almost all art forms. All good movies have those moments of stillness, all good conversations have those long spaces, most paintings have patches of featureless color, all novels have moments of long contemplation.</description>

      <title>Why I Dance</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. Turns out this is a really hard question. The biggest difficulty is probably trying to understand what it means to do something with your life.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m coming back from a dance meet-up with some old friends and new, a little tipsy and drinking some more, and a lot exhilarated from moving on the dance floor.</description>

      <title>Being Alone</title>

      <description>I came home today from the gym all sweaty and smelly and quite content. As I threw my bags on the bed and settled down, I had a great urge to open up my laptop and check something online. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been becoming increasing aware of this internet addiction that seems more and more unavoidable.
I resisted and just laid myself down on my bed staring at the ceiling. Perhaps for the first time I noticed how beautifully the walls of my house are painted.</description>

      <description>I love words.
I found this wholesome link on Reddit while I was doing some work (*cough*). As the US is riling under Mr. Pai&amp;rsquo;s proud accomplishments there are some countries that have figured it all out.
 Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalogue – called Bókatíðindi (‘Book Bulletin’, in English) – that is sent to every household in the country in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair.</description>

      <description>Zugzwang
 (n.) a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one&amp;rsquo;s turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage, often in the final years of grad school.
   Zugzywangy.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.</description>

      <description>I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?
In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside.</description>
