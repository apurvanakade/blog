  <div class="post"><p>I gave an hour long talk at the <a href="https://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/prizes-competitions-organizations/northwestern-undergraduate-math-society.html">NU Math Club</a> yesterday about Lean and theorem proving.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-went-well">Things that went well</h2>
<p>It was fun to talk about Lean and to show examples.
The most fun bit was playing with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoskinson-ml.lean-chat-vscode">Lean Chat plugin</a> for VS Code, which has gotten quite good now.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-did-not-go-well">Things that did not go well</h2>
<p>It was a bit tedious to talk about Type Theory.
I need to find better ways to motivate and explain Type Theory, especially the significance of constructors.
I could do examples from Haskell or Lean to just show the thing in action.</p>
<p>I could have just skipped the type theory bit completely and just spent the entire time talking about Lean and perhaps doing an example from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="to-do">To Do</h2>
<p>As I was preparing for the talk, I came across <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-math-theorem-proving/">this blog post</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11491">associated paper</a>  by FacebookAI which claims to have made improvements in AI assisted theorem proving. I need to read more about it.</p>
<p>I also need to find some expository texts on Type Theory, especially about the Type Theory used in Lean.</p>
