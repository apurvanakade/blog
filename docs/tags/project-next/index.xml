      <description>I was at a 5 day Project NExT workshop. I heard from a lot of interesting people and learned a lot about teaching. The thing that stood out to me the most was just how different math researchers are from math educators. Math researchers mostly share a feeling of contempt toward people, people are just means of discovering math, whereas math educators care only about people, math just happens to be thing they teach.</description>
