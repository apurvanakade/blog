      <description>&#34;The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don&#39;t.&#34;  Rereading the five books in The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide trilogy is the best self-care I’ve done throughout the pandemic.
I would have loved to meet Douglas Adams, what a great guy he must have been to be friends with! It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to imagine the kind of personality and world view one would have to have to create such an imaginative and fascinating adventure story.</description>

But it’s very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed.&#34;  I do not think I understand this book at all.</description>
