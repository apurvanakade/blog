      <description>Going in, I was quite skeptical of this movie. I had seen the trailer and it looked pretentious. There were a hundred different big named actors in a hundred-min-long movie. It seemed too fake to be good. It did not help that the theater I was in was bad with a small, awkwardly placed screen, seats that did not recline, and poor sound quality. At the start of the movie I could barely make out what the actors were saying or what was happening on the screen, each scene being so densely packed with detail.</description>

      <description>I always wonder what exactly is the world that Wes Anderson sees, does he really see things the way he portrays them in his movies? What a great gift to have, I&amp;rsquo;m so envious!
Like all other Wes Anderson movies, Isle of Dogs makes no pretense of being serious or dark in any way. At the very start, there is a narrator who announces that this is a tale and introduces the story.</description>
