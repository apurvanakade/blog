- 1Q84
What most surprised me about 1Q84 is that I actually liked reading it! I have read enough Murakami that as I was reading the book I knew that he was not going to explain anything and yet I did not feel frustrated. I have developed a taste for his writing. In Murakami&amp;rsquo;s novels, it is futile to look for resolutions or explanations or logic or reason.</description>
