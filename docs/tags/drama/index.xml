      <description>&amp;ldquo;When people finish their day and hurry home, my day starts. My diner is open from midnight to seven in the morning. They call it &amp;ldquo;Midnight Diner&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s all I have on my menu. But I make whatever customers request as long as I have the ingredients for it. That&amp;rsquo;s my policy. Do I even have customers? More than you would expect.&amp;quot;
   This is the most wholesome TV series ever.</description>

      <description>Memories of Murder, which is a Korean movie, is one of my favorite detective movies. I like Korean movies a lot, so I decided to try out some Korean TV. And now Season 1 of Stranger, a Korean series, is one of my favorite detective series!
The series is not innovative or unique in any way. But it is very well executed. The characters are diverse, likeable, and well-developed, the cast is great with genuinely good acting, the story is tight with just enough melodrama, every episode ends in a cliff hanger, the pacing is perfect, there are no miracles or accidents, nothing hidden from the audience - whatever the protagonist knows the audience knows, thrilling soundtrack; a textbook example of how to make a good detective show, a masterpiece.</description>

      <description>Of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost the patience to watch long TV shows. Surprisingly, the pandemic made me want to watch series even less and instead I wasted a lot of time on YouTube watching short British comedy clips. I was then pleasantly surprised when I got hooked on to watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix.
Growing up reading primarily British authors, I have developed some fascination with their history. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that their history is intertwined with India.</description>

      <description>I love the adaptations of graphic novels. I love contrasting and comparing the two art forms and seeing how they bring out completely different aspects of the same story.
The comics are a collection of short stories whereas the series is closer to a novel. In the comics, the characters have very singular personality traits. They are caricatures and not recognizable as human beings. All of them are extremely damaged and there is a singular desire or a past trauma that determines their actions.</description>

      <description>I have always loved sci-fi. I love sci-fi more than I love actual science. Sci-fi is hardly ever about science. It is imaginative and fantastic. It is always about people. For exactly this reason, Dark is a fantastic sci-fi. In its three seasons, the lives of its handful characters get deeply and inextricably intertwined and the actors performing these roles give candid performances that makes all the chaos thoroughly believable.</description>

      <description>I am fascinated by Japan, the country that has produced Naruto, Bleach, Akira, Ghost in the shell, Murakami, Ishiguro, Miyazaki and so much more. An inward-looking, closed island riddled with lost youth and a dying population that has somehow managed to preserve its culture in the present and has had so much influence on the world. It is mystical, fantastic, spiritual, and simultaneously one of the biggest purveyors of porn.</description>
