      <description>My favorite part about William Gibson&amp;rsquo;s writing is his world building. He is truly a visionary, an understatement about the guy who envisioned The Matrix. What kept me getting back to The Peripheral was Gibson&amp;rsquo;s unique take on how humans would eventually merge with technology and the resulting fragmentation of society. In Neuromancer the world is chaotically dystopian, in The Peripheral the world is forlornly so.
I find Gibson&amp;rsquo;s writing style intriguing, very synesthetic and schizophrenic.</description>

      <description>&#34;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&#34; -Neuromancer  I always knew that The Matrix had to have found it&amp;rsquo;s concepts from some book, it was too revolutionary a movie to have spawned out of nothing. And I finally found it - Neuromancer, the archetypal cyberpunk novel.
This is probably the hardest and simultaneously the most riveting sci-fi novel I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.</description>
