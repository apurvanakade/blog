      <description>Made by the same director who directed the Vengeance trilogy and the Handmaiden.
The actress, Tang Wei, is phenomenal. Throughout the movie you cannot make up your mind as to whether she is the victim or a femme fatale or if those two are even meaningfully distinguishable. The ease and authenticity with which she (and the actor) acts in some of the intense scenes is quite disturbing.
The editing and sound is smartly used to convey the insomnia of the actor.</description>
