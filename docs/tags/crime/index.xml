      <description>Of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost the patience to watch long TV shows. Surprisingly, the pandemic made me want to watch series even less and instead I wasted a lot of time on YouTube watching short British comedy clips. I was then pleasantly surprised when I got hooked on to watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix.
Growing up reading primarily British authors, I have developed some fascination with their history. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that their history is intertwined with India.</description>
