      <description>With every Camus book there are two major problems:
 The writing is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French. The meaning is purposefully contrived, possibly lost in translation from French.  In spite of this, I just cannot get enough of his books. He is the most enlightened person I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.
The Fall is the story of a benevolent lawyer who is always going out of his ways to help others, a hugely successful lawyer who offers his services to the poor for free.</description>

      <description>“Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.”  The central question, says Camus, is that of suicide. If you are going to die one day, why not just kill yourself now?
Starting from here, he develops the philosophy of the absurd.</description>
