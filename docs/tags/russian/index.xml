      <description>&amp;ldquo;What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?&amp;quot;
 Crime and Punishment is Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s criticism of naive rationalism, utilitarianism, and armchair philosophizing. For such a boring topic, this is a surprisingly fun read. Adhering to his own criticism, Dostoevsky does not take to prophesying and making grand philosophical arguments about the pros and cons of communism but instead weaves an interesting and entertaining narrative of what might happen if one were to take rationalism to its extreme.</description>
